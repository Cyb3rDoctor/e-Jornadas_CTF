## Solution:

First of all, Thanks to my teammate KOOLI for solving this challenge with me ðŸ–¤


...

<br/><br/>

We spent a lot of time searching... And my teammate sent me that he found something that looks interesting:

<br/><br/>

We found cannons and a bell on that ship (**Dom Fernando II e GlÃ³ria**), and that what we are looking for according to the challenge description...

Then, we started searching for a number near the bell and the cannons on that ship... (**We used Google Maps Street View**)

...

While checking the street view, I found a man standing near the bell with a number on his Tshirt!!!

<br/><br/>

I told that to my teammate and both of us thought that it was a weird idea

<br/><br/>

But when we tried it, it was correct!!!
