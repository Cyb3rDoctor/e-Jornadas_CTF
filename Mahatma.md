## Solution:

Mahatma Gandhi died in 1948, and we are looking for a Mayor who (((**permanently**))) brought Mahatma to Lisbon, so we are not looking for the real Mahatma Gandhi...

So, I searched for (Mahatma in Lisbon):

<br/><br/>

Then I used Google Translate to understand what is written on that statue...

<br/><br/>

**According to what is written on that statue, it was inaugurated in 1998...**

<br/><br/>

So, I searched for a list of Lisbon mayors, because I need to find who was the mayor of Lisbon in 1998:

**The mayor in 1998 was João Soares**
